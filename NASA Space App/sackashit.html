	<h1>To Do List:</h1>
	<p>
		We need to: <br/>
		Get a map, and make it interactive by having scrolling seasons and the ability to compare 2 places, <br />
		Find analysis of the data found on the NASA website, inclusing information on the geographic effects on blooming, <br />
		And after all that, we'll have the basic idea done.
